<h1 style='font-family: helvetica;'> UCL Question Creator User Guide </h1>
<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> Welcome to the Question Creator, where the Quiz Master can create a set questions with a location. Stored from a database which can be later called by Quizlet user. </p>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> The left hand column contains the form for question creation where the text boxes can be used to enter a question and four answer options. </p>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> The map interface can now be used to decide the location of your question, drag and drop the marker to input your position into the point co-ordinate area.</p>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> You may find a different basemap may aid in question positioning. Feel free to look through a range of basemap options under the map layers button at the top right of the map.</p>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> These include: </p>
<ul style='font-family: helvetica;'>
	<li>Plain: A clean clear basemap, minimalist in style.</li>
	<li>Scenic: A more detailed basemap, highlighting green space areas and transport points of interest.</li>
	<li>Satellite: Satellite imagery, giving a imagery representation of the area from above.</li>
</ul>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> Finally select the answer number from the drop down menu, that corresponds with the correct answer entered earlier. </p>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> When you are ready click the upload button in the top right hand corner to submit the question to the database. </p>

<p style='font-family: helvetica;'> You can view the repositories used to make this application, the quiz application and the server at my github. Follow the <i class="fab fa-github-square"></i> in the top right hand corner of the app. </p>
